  <h1>Benefits of Aikido Training</h1>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Aikido training provides many physical and psychological benefits. The universality of this martial art makes it ideal for everyone regardless of age, gender or physical condition.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>Aikido as a martial art</h2>
    <p>To understand Aikido and its advantages, one must understand that as a traditional Japanese martial art, it is something more than just an effective method of self-defense. It is a form of Budō (武道 budō - the way of the warrior, the art of war). The word "do" in Japanese means the same as the Chinese word "tao" - the path to understanding, self-improvement, something achieved throughout life.</p>
    <p>In Japanese history, as in many other cultures, martial arts were considered exceptionally practical. Not only for use in war, but also for self-improvement of character. The virtues and principles of the ideal warrior (Bushidō - 武士道 bushi-dō, the way of the warrior) - courage, honesty, compassion, sincerity - are also desirable traits of every human being. The traditions of Japanese martial arts, like chivalry in Europe, have always emphasized the importance of these principles in daily life, and understanding them is the essence of Budo. The warrior's way of life is not just fighting, but continuous striving for self-improvement in all its aspects.</p>
    <p>The ideal of chivalry in European cultures was a powerful warrior who was also sensitive and merciful. Similarly, the model samurai was not a simple warrior. It was a balanced human being, a warrior fulfilling the motto Bun Bu Ryodo: "warrior and sage in one." In this way, he could be truly useful and serve others.</p>
    <p>These traditions are as relevant today and are taught through traditional martial arts such as Aikido. Every aspect of training aims at both physical and psychological development, so that the knowledge gained and self-development achieved positively affect all aspects of life.</p>
    <p>A true adept of martial arts sees conflicts not only as competition with others, but as an opportunity to shape oneself and overcome the true enemy which is oneself. Living this way best defines Shugyo (the deepest possible spiritual training). O-Sensei Morihei Ueshiba's (founder of Aikido) favorite saying was Masakatsu, Agatsu ("True victory is victory over oneself") - which perfectly describes what Aikido training is.</p>

    <h2>Physical benefits</h2>
    <p>Aikido training is accompanied by concrete physical benefits. Through it, we comprehensively improve physical fitness, flexibility and learn to relax.</p>
    <p>The human body can draw strength from two sources: muscle contractions or the dynamics of a relaxed body.</p>
    <p>Many physical exercises, such as weightlifting, focus on the first aspect. This means that specific muscles or their groups are exercised in isolation to improve their mass, volume and strength. At the same time, neglecting the movement and coordination of the whole body. Consequently, while muscle size and power increase, the way of using them is impaired. This way of training leads to increased tension and stress on joints and decreased flexibility. The result may be aesthetically pleasing, but when excessive is actually harmful to overall health.</p>
    <p>The second type of strength - dynamic, is most often developed during activities such as dance or gymnastics. During these, the body must learn to move in a coordinated and relaxed manner. Aikido also emphasizes this type of training.</p>
    <p>Although both types are important, it's worth noting that a person who focuses on the second aspect can often overcome someone much larger or stronger. When the first is limited by the strength (size) of their muscles, the second benefits from the power and dynamics of the whole body. They learn not to tense individual muscles but to draw strength from the center through which force naturally spreads through the whole body to relaxed limbs. We can illustrate this with the example of a stick and a whip. One stiff and hard, the other flexible and relaxed.</p>
    <p>Aikido develops the body in a unique way. Aerobic fitness is achieved through intensive training. Joint and connective tissue flexibility develops through various stretching exercises and through the techniques themselves. Relaxation is taught automatically, because without it techniques won't work. Balanced use of both energy sources enables even a small person to generate enormous power.</p>

    <h2>Psychological benefits</h2>
    <p>Aikido training does not perceive the body and mind as separate entities. The condition of one affects the state of the other. For this reason, learning to relax from Aikido training naturally also affects a tense mind. Similarly, perseverance and self-confidence, which are developed mentally, manifest in the way one moves or their posture.</p>
    <p>Every psychological aspect must find reflection in the body and vice versa. Otherwise, under pressure (stress) it fades and we return to ingrained habits and negative patterns of behavior.</p>
    <p>Aikido training requires honestly confronting conflicts, not fleeing from them. Through these experiences, the Aikido practitioner learns to face life's adversities in a proactive, constructive way. The previous habit of avoiding conflicts (external and internal), which often lead to even greater problems, is replaced by the courage and strength to overcome them while maintaining the humility and modesty that are particularly emphasized throughout Aikido training - getting rid of ego.</p>
    <p>In modern times, Aikido has become known and widely used in circles of psychologists and businesspeople as a highly useful form of learning conflict resolution strategies. Aikido philosophy is widely applied to improve quality and functioning of life in many social and business spheres.</p>

    <h2>Aikido as a form of self-defense</h2>
    <p>In Japan, the nation that created many martial arts, Aikido is the one chosen for teaching the elite "Tokyo Metropolitan Riot Police" and "Secret Police." The reason for this can be found in its incredible flexibility.</p>
    <p>Unlike other martial arts, Aikido techniques can be applied with varying intensity, from gentle controlling techniques to the strongest remedial measures. Aikido is therefore ideal for application in a wide range of situations and many institutions. It allows controlling an aggressor without harming them while protecting oneself.</p>

    <h2>Aikido in daily life</h2>
    <p>Ultimately, Aikido training becomes part of our daily life. The lessons from it accompany us at every moment.</p>
    <p>Almost every moment of our life is accompanied by some conflict - with others, with the environment, our body, or ourselves. However, it's up to us whether we avoid them out of fear of confronting them, or whether we see in them an opportunity for change, learning and development.</p>
    <p>For self-development, some kind of discipline and improvement is necessary. To develop awareness, determination, inner strength or compassion, we must experience difficulties and face them. You can't develop (improve yourself) by avoiding life. Aikido philosophy, following this reasoning, shows that our dojo (hall/building where we practice) is something more than just a building. Our true dojo is our life.</p>
    <p>Seen this way, life becomes rich and filled with meaning. Every situation gives an opportunity for greater development. We learn to be open to experiences, instead of avoiding unpleasant aspects of life. Thanks to this we develop and become stronger.</p>
    <p>This is the true heritage of martial arts and the real value of Aikido training. O-Sensei dreamed that all nations of the world would train together in peace for mutual benefit. Thanks to the positive values conveyed through martial arts, Aikido continues to grow and spread throughout the world, realizing this vision.</p>
