  <h1>What is Aikido?</h1>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Masakatsu agatsu (Aikido is winning over oneself, every day.)</p>
    <author>O-Sensei Morihei Ueshiba</author>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="article">
    <p>Aikido is a martial art based on a system of locks, throws, and strikes combined with traditional Japanese swordsmanship using sword, staff, and knife. It was codified by Morihei Ueshiba in the early 20th century. The goal of Aikido is to defend against an opponent without the need to harm them.</p>
    
    <p>Aikido loosely translates to <strong>"The Way of Harmony with Ki"</strong> (合気道):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ai</strong> (合) - harmony, unification</li>
      <li><strong>Ki</strong> (気) - life energy, spirit</li>
      <li><strong>Do</strong> (道) - way, path</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Four Fundamental Principles of Aikido</h2>

    <p>In our lineage, stemming from the teachings of Shihan Fumio Toyoda, we place special emphasis on the <strong>Four Basic Principles</strong>, which are the foundation of all practice:</p>

    <div class="principles">
      <div class="principle-card">
        <h3>1. Keep One Point (Seika no Itten - 臍下一点)</h3>
        <p><strong>Keep one point</strong> - Focus attention on a point about 5 cm below the navel (hara, tanden). This is the physical and mental center of our body. When we are concentrated on this point, our energy is stable and unified.</p>
        <p><em>Practice:</em> In every technique, in every movement, awareness should remain in the center. Don't let attention wander to the limbs or head.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <h3>2. Relax Completely (Kanzen ni Rirakkusu - 完全にリラックス)</h3>
        <p><strong>Relax completely</strong> - True strength doesn't come from muscle tension, but from relaxation and natural energy flow. A relaxed body can react faster and more effectively than a tense one.</p>
        <p><em>Practice:</em> Let gravity work naturally. Keep only as much tension as needed to maintain posture - nothing more. Breathe naturally and deeply.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <h3>3. Keep Weight Underside (Omosa o Shitagawa ni Tamotsu - 重みを下側に保つ)</h3>
        <p><strong>Keep weight underside</strong> - Energy should flow downward, to the earth, not rise upward. Strong tree roots allow it to survive a storm. Similarly, when our weight is settled low, we are stable and firmly rooted.</p>
        <p><em>Practice:</em> Imagine your energy flowing through your feet deep into the earth. Knees slightly bent, hips relaxed, body weight evenly distributed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <h3>4. Extend Ki (Ki o Dashite - 気を出して)</h3>
        <p><strong>Extend Ki</strong> - Energy doesn't end at our skin, but extends beyond the body to infinity. When we extend Ki, we become one with our surroundings and partner. Techniques become natural and effortless.</p>
        <p><em>Practice:</em> Imagine a stream of light or water flowing from your fingers far beyond your body. Don't pull energy back - always direct it forward, toward the goal.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>What is Do (道) - The Way?</h2>

    <p>The Way is not a destination, but a process. It's daily improvement, step by step. The path to self-perfection, earning a black belt, learning techniques, folding hakama, consistency, humility. And at the same time - a way without a goal. A way that is an effort undertaken every day to be better. A path to achieving harmony.</p>

    <p>In Japanese tradition, <strong>-do</strong> (way) means that the art is something more than just a set of techniques. It is a way of life, a path of spiritual development. Just like Chado (way of tea), Shodo (way of calligraphy), or Kendo (way of the sword) - Aikido is a lifelong path.</p>

    <h2>What is Aiki (合気) - Harmony?</h2>

    <p>Harmony is balance, equilibrium, accepting oneself and pushing oneself further, toward new goals, efforts to be even better, calm, ready, balanced. It's appreciating one's life every day and respecting the lives of others. Fluid body movements when performing kata. Being at peace with oneself.</p>

    <p><strong>Aiki</strong> is not just harmony as peace, but harmony as unification - joining your energy with your partner's energy, directing their attack in a safe direction. It's the art of leading, not resisting. As O-Sensei said: <em>"True budo is learning to receive an attack with gratitude."</em></p>

    <h2>What is Ki (気)?</h2>

    <p>In traditional Japanese beliefs, it is a spiritual force, life energy permeating everything. In the human body, it concentrates in <strong>hara</strong> (tanden) - the lower part of the abdomen, about 5 cm below the navel.</p>

    <p>Ki manifests in many aspects of practice:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Physically:</strong> Center of gravity, balance, stability when performing technique</li>
      <li><strong>Breath:</strong> Even, deep breathing during randori and training (kokyu)</li>
      <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Perfect sense of the moment when technique becomes natural</li>
      <li><strong>Kiai:</strong> A shout originating from hara, expressing fullness of energy</li>
      <li><strong>Calm:</strong> Unwavering presence of mind during threat (fudoshin)</li>
      <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Daily meditation (misogi), breathing exercises (kokyu-ho)</li>
      <li><strong>Energy:</strong> The force that pushes us forward every day</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Masakatsu Agatsu - True Victory</h2>

    <p><strong>"Masakatsu Agatsu Katsuhayabi"</strong> (正勝吾勝勝速日) - "True victory is victory over oneself"</p>

    <p>This most famous saying of O-Sensei is the heart of Aikido philosophy. It's not about defeating an external enemy, but about overcoming one's own weaknesses, fears, ego. Every training is an opportunity to confront yourself - with your physical, mental, and spiritual limitations.</p>

    <p>A true warrior doesn't seek battle, but perfects themselves. And when they must face conflict, they do so with harmony and compassion, not with aggression.</p>

    <h2>Shugyo - Severe Training</h2>

    <p>Aikido is <strong>shugyo</strong> - severe, systematic training of oneself, both in physical and mental aspects. It's a practice that requires perseverance, humility, and dedication. There are no shortcuts on the path to mastery.</p>

    <p>Every bow, every fall, every technique repeated hundreds of times - all of this constitutes shugyo. It's not just exercising the body, but purifying the spirit, hardening character, building unbreakable will.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"A day without training is a wasted day. Aikido must be practiced every day to become a true part of ourselves."</p>
      <cite>Shihan Fumio Toyoda</cite>
