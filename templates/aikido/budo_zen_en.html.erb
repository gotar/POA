    <h1>Budo and Zen in Aikido</h1>
    <h2>武道と禅 - Mushin, Zanshin and the ethics of the warrior</h2>

    <p>
      Aikido is more than locks and throws. It is <strong>budo</strong> (the way of the warrior) and a practice 
      that shapes character, teaches respect, and cultivates inner calm. In our lineage we emphasize the 
      connection between Aikido and <strong>Zen</strong> – mindfulness, simplicity, and presence.
    </p>

    <h2>Budo (武道) - A path, not a fight</h2>
    <p>
      Budo means “the way of the warrior.” Modern Aikido is not about aggression – it is a path of 
      self-mastery. The goal is not to defeat an opponent, but to <strong>overcome fear, anger, and ego</strong>.
      When the mind is clear, technique becomes natural and effective.
    </p>

    <h2>Zen in Aikido practice</h2>
    <p>
      Zen teaches clarity and simplicity. In the dojo it appears as <strong>mokuso</strong> (short meditation), 
      mindful breathing, and a calm, focused movement. When the mind is quiet, the body responds without tension.

        <h3>Mushin (無心) - “no-mind”</h3>
        <p>
          A state free from inner noise and fear. Mushin is a mind that does not cling to thoughts, 
          allowing us to respond smoothly and appropriately.

      <div class="principle-card">
        <h3>Zanshin (残心) - “remaining mind”</h3>
        <p>
          Full awareness after the technique ends. Zanshin is readiness and attention that continue 
          even when the movement is complete.
        </p>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <h3>Fudoshin (不動心) - “immovable mind”</h3>
        <p>
          Inner stability under pressure. Fudoshin is calm that does not yield to panic, impulse, 
          or provocation.

    <h2>Bushido and the 7 virtues of the warrior</h2>
    <p>
      Aikido is not classical bushido, but samurai values influence dojo ethics. In practice we focus on:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gi</strong> – integrity and justice</li>
      <li><strong>Rei</strong> – respect and etiquette</li>
      <li><strong>Yu</strong> – courage</li>
      <li><strong>Meiyo</strong> – honor</li>
      <li><strong>Jin</strong> – compassion</li>
      <li><strong>Makoto</strong> – sincerity</li>
      <li><strong>Chu</strong> – loyalty and responsibility</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to cultivate these values in practice</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Train regularly</strong> – discipline builds character.</li>
      <li><strong>Care for ukemi</strong> – humility and willingness to learn.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice reishiki</strong> – respect for partner and dojo.</li>
      <li><strong>Breathe consciously</strong> – calms mind and body.</li>
      <li><strong>Support others</strong> – the dojo is community, not competition.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“True budo is the love and protection of all things.”</p>
      <cite>O-Sensei Morihei Ueshiba</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This is why Aikido is a path for a lifetime. Budo and Zen are not theory – they are daily work on oneself, 
      expressed in every movement and every bow.
