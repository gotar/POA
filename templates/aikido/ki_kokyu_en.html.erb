    <h1>Ki and Kokyu - Energy and Breath</h1>
    <h2>気と呼吸 - The Foundation of Power in Aikido</h2>

    <p>
      At the heart of Aikido lie two concepts that distinguish this art from purely physical forms of combat: 
      <strong>Ki</strong> (life energy) and <strong>Kokyu</strong> (breath power). 
      These elements allow for the generation of power that does not depend on muscular strength, 
      but rather on the harmony between mind, body, and the universe.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Ki (気)?</h2>
    <p>
      The word <em>Ki</em> appears in many Japanese terms: <em>kuki</em> (air), 
      <em>genki</em> (health/energy), <em>tenki</em> (weather). In the context of martial arts, 
      it represents the universal life energy that flows through all living things.
    </p>
    <p>
      O-Sensei Morihei Ueshiba described Ki as the "vital energy of the universe." 
      In Aikido, we do not try to accumulate Ki only for ourselves, but strive for 
      <strong>Aiki</strong> – harmonizing our energy with that of our partner and the environment. 
      When our Ki is "extended" (<em>Ki no Nagare</em>), movement becomes fluid, 
      and the body becomes stable and difficult to move.
    </p>

    <h2>Kokyu (呼吸) - Breath Power</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Kokyu</em> literally means inhalation and exhalation. However, in Budo, we speak of <strong>Kokyu-ryoku</strong> 
      – breath power. This is not the strength of the lungs, but the ability to unite the mind's intention 
      with the body's movement through breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through proper breathing, the power generated in the body's center (<em>Hara</em>) is 
      transmitted to the hands and feet without unnecessary muscular tension. This is why 
      Aikido masters can throw much stronger opponents with a smile and lightness.

    <h2>Core Principles of Ki and Kokyu</h2>
    <div class="principles">
      <div class="principle-card">
        <h3>Seika Tanden (脐下丹田)</h3>
        <p>
          The center of gravity and energy, located a few centimeters below the navel. 
          All techniques should originate from here.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <h3>Ki no Nagare (気の流れ)</h3>
        <p>
          The flow of energy. Instead of stopping an attack, we let the energy flow, 
          taking it over and directing it in a direction that is safe for us.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <h3>Kokyu-ho (呼吸法)</h3>
        <p>
          Breathing exercises that teach how to synchronize breath with a partner's movement 
          to gain an advantage without using force.
        </p>

    <h2>Key Relational Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Musubi (結び)</strong> – connection. Tying your energy with your partner's energy so as to become one.</li>
      <li><strong>Ma-ai (間合い)</strong> – distance and timing. The proper interval that allows for the free flow of Ki.</li>
      <li><strong>Kuzushi (崩し)</strong> – unbalancing. In Aikido, this often happens by "leading" the partner's Ki.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Practice Ki and Kokyu?</h2>
    <p>
      Developing Ki does not happen overnight. It requires:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Relaxation</strong> – Tense muscles block the flow of energy.</li>
      <li><strong>Awareness</strong> – Being here and now, feeling every finger and foot.</li>
      <li><strong>Regular practice of Kokyu-dosa</strong> – A seated exercise with a partner that serves as a "laboratory" for breath power.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"True power does not come from the muscles, but from the breath and unification with nature."</p>
      <cite>Morihei Ueshiba</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      We invite you to explore these mysteries together on the mat. Understanding Ki and Kokyu is the key to 
      discovering the depth of Aikido as a Way (Do).
