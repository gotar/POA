    <p>
      Bushido means “the way of the warrior,” but its value goes far beyond samurai history.
      It is a practical code for decision-making under pressure: how to choose correctly when it is costly,
      how to handle failure without excuses, and how to build character that stays stable when comfort disappears.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the dojo, Bushido is not theory. You see it in how you enter the mat, how you respond to correction,
      how you treat weaker partners, and how you behave after a failed technique.
      Off the mat it works exactly the same way: not through dramatic statements,
      but through repeated, small choices that become your standard.
    </p>

    <h2>The seven virtues of Bushido</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gi (義) — righteousness:</strong> choosing what is right, even when it is costly.</li>
      <li><strong>Yu (勇) — courage:</strong> acting in the presence of fear and uncertainty.</li>
      <li><strong>Jin (仁) — benevolence:</strong> strength guided by care for others.</li>
      <li><strong>Rei (礼) — respect:</strong> disciplined conduct that reflects character.</li>
      <li><strong>Makoto (誠) — sincerity:</strong> alignment between words, intent, and action.</li>
      <li><strong>Meiyo (名誉) — honor:</strong> responsibility for your name and reputation.</li>
      <li><strong>Chugi (忠義) — loyalty:</strong> fidelity to commitments and community.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bushido on the mat</h2>
    <p>
      Righteousness means honest training: no technical shortcuts just to look good.
      Courage means facing weak areas instead of repeating only what feels comfortable.
      Respect means controlling force and protecting your partner.
      Honor means owning your mistakes without blaming fatigue, stress, or circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
      The higher the level, the less room there is for ego. Bushido sets priorities clearly:
      quality before speed, process before outcome. This makes technique not only effective,
      but reliable and safe.
    </p>

    <h2>Bushido beyond the dojo</h2>
    <p>
      At work, Bushido means clear standards: keep your word, close loops, do not shift blame.
      In relationships, it means loyalty and honesty without drama. In crisis, it means
      value-based action instead of emotional reaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      This path is demanding because it removes the convenient option of “just this once.”
      But that is exactly why it builds durability. A person without standards performs well only in easy conditions.
      A person with standards performs well when it gets hard.
    </p>

    <h2>Common misunderstandings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bushido is harshness without empathy</strong> — no. Strength and compassion must work together.</li>
      <li><strong>Bushido is discipline for its own sake</strong> — no. Discipline serves quality of decision-making.</li>
      <li><strong>Bushido belongs to the past</strong> — no. It is a modern model of accountable action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Bushido is not a costume and not a romantic myth. It is daily character practice:
      choose integrity when shortcuts are easier, choose courage when waiting feels safer,
      choose responsibility when blaming others would be convenient.
      That is how a durable human standard is forged.
