    <p>
      Jiko Sekinin means personal responsibility for decisions, actions, and outcomes.
      It is one of the toughest and most liberating parts of Japanese ethics:
      stop searching for someone to blame, start managing what is within your control.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not self-punishment. It is operational realism.
      When something fails, the first question becomes: “What can I improve in my own process?”
      That restores agency and accelerates growth.
    </p>

    <h2>Jiko Sekinin on the mat</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Acknowledge mistakes quickly:</strong> no excuses, no ego defense.</li>
      <li><strong>Correct the process:</strong> fix causes, not only visible symptoms.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow through:</strong> implement change and verify results.</li>
      <li><strong>Protect safety:</strong> own your force control and partner care.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In practice, the loop is simple: notice → name → fix → verify.
      Without this loop, people repeat the same errors while waiting for luck to improve things.
    </p>

    <h2>Jiko Sekinin beyond the dojo</h2>
    <p>
      At work, it means ownership of outcomes, communication quality, and commitments.
      In relationships, it means accountability for your reactions, words, and promises.
      In personal life, it means choices that serve long-term goals instead of short-term excuses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jiko Sekinin does not mean everything depends only on you.
      It means that regardless of external conditions, you fully own your side of the equation.
      That alone is enough to produce meaningful change.
    </p>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Confusing responsibility with guilt:</strong> goal is improvement, not self-attack.</li>
      <li><strong>Perfectionism:</strong> responsibility means progress, not impossible flawlessness.</li>
      <li><strong>Words without implementation:</strong> behavior change matters more than statements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Jiko Sekinin builds reliable, high-agency people.
      Instead of collecting alibis, you design better systems.
      On the mat, this creates safer and faster learning.
      Beyond the mat, it produces decisions you can defend over time.
