    <p>
      Omoiyari is one of the most valuable principles in Japanese relational culture.
      In simple terms: attentive care for another person before they need to ask.
      It is active empathy, not performative empathy — not just “I understand,”
      but concrete behavior that reduces unnecessary burden for others.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the dojo, Omoiyari shapes safety and training quality.
      Your partner is not a tool for your technique; they are a co-creator of the process.
      You read tension, calibrate force, respect limits, and build trust.
      Without that, technical progress remains shallow.
    </p>

    <h2>Omoiyari on the mat</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Listen to the body:</strong> detect risk signals before injury appears.</li>
      <li><strong>Control force:</strong> the goal is learning quality, not domination.</li>
      <li><strong>Communicate clearly:</strong> clear pace, clear intention, clear boundaries.</li>
      <li><strong>Mutual development:</strong> support your partner’s growth instead of competing for appearance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Practiced daily, Omoiyari strengthens dojo culture.
      People train more courageously because they feel safe.
      And safety is a prerequisite for high-quality progress.
    </p>

    <h2>Omoiyari beyond the dojo</h2>
    <p>
      At work, Omoiyari means anticipating team load, sharing information clearly,
      and offering support before crisis escalates. In relationships, it means small reliable actions:
      listening with attention, being on time, and keeping promises.
    </p>

    <p>
      Omoiyari is not submission. It should coexist with boundaries.
      Respecting others does not require abandoning respect for yourself.
      Mature care combines empathy with responsibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Common misunderstandings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Omoiyari is just being nice:</strong> no. It is attentiveness plus action.</li>
      <li><strong>Omoiyari means no standards:</strong> no. You can be demanding and caring at the same time.</li>
      <li><strong>Omoiyari weakens performance:</strong> no. It builds trust and stable cooperation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Omoiyari is mature relational strength.
      It teaches you to see others before conflict appears and to act in ways that support shared process.
      On the mat, it creates safety and better technique. Beyond the mat, it builds relationships grounded
      in practical respect.
