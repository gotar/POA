      <h1>Zanshin (残心)</h1>
      <p class="concept-hero-subtitle">“Remaining mind” — calm awareness that continues after action.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Zanshin literally means “remaining mind.” In practice, it is awareness that does not
      switch off when the movement ends. The technique is done, but your attention stays active:
      breath, distance, partner, and consequences.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not tension or nervous hyper-alertness. Zanshin is composed readiness.
      It reduces autopilot decisions and protects the final phase of execution,
      where many errors usually appear.
    </p>

    <h2>Zanshin ≠ Zenshin (important distinction)</h2>
    <p>
      These words are often confused because they sound similar, but they are different concepts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Zanshin (残心):</strong> awareness that remains <strong>after</strong> action.</li>
      <li><strong>Zenshin (前進):</strong> moving forward, emphasis on progress.</li>
      <li><strong>Zenshin (全身):</strong> whole body, full physical engagement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In short: Zenshin drives forward; Zanshin protects quality after execution.
      That “after” moment is what separates mature control from rushed completion.
    </p>

    <h2>Zanshin on the mat</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No drop after technique:</strong> maintain finishing structure, distance, and timing.</li>
      <li><strong>Close the loop:</strong> evaluate outcome, not only movement mechanics.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep axis and breath:</strong> avoid post-action collapse of posture and focus.</li>
      <li><strong>Read your partner:</strong> respond to reality, not expectation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Zanshin beyond the dojo</h2>
    <p>
      At work, it means closing tasks with effect validation: you send the message,
      then confirm understanding and downstream impact. In communication,
      it means listening to the response instead of preparing your next line.
      In daily life, it means a brief pause before reaction and deliberate completion of process.
    </p>

    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Premature closure:</strong> declaring completion immediately after action.</li>
      <li><strong>Confusing awareness with stiffness:</strong> excess tension harms precision.</li>
      <li><strong>No feedback loop:</strong> action without checking real outcome.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The opposite of Zanshin is not stillness — it is premature closure.
      If you want better training quality, cleaner execution, and stronger decisions under pressure,
      train awareness that continues <em>after</em> the move.
      That is where durability and control are forged.
