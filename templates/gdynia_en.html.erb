    <h2>What is Aikido?</h2>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Aikido</strong> is a Japanese martial art that teaches self-defense without the need 
      to harm your opponent. In our school, we emphasize:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Effective self-defense</strong> - techniques based on biomechanics, not physical strength</li>
      <li><strong>Physical development</strong> - improved fitness, flexibility, and coordination</li>
      <li><strong>Mindfulness</strong> - stress reduction, concentration, body awareness</li>
      <li><strong>Etiquette and culture</strong> - traditional Japanese approach to martial arts</li>
    </ul>
