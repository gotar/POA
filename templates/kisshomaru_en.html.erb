    <h3>Legacy and Mission</h3>

    <p>
      After his father's death in 1969, Kisshomaru Ueshiba assumed the role of Doshu (Master of the Way) -
      the highest authority in the world of Aikido. His life mission was to systematize
      and spread Aikido throughout the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks to his tireless efforts, Aikido transformed from an esoteric martial art
      practiced by a handful of chosen students into a discipline accessible to all,
      practiced today by millions of people around the world.
