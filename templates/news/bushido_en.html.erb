    <p>
      Bushido means "the way of the warrior" and describes the code of values that shaped the samurai mindset for centuries.
      It is not only military history — it is a practical framework for anyone who wants to act with integrity,
      courage, and consistency.
    </p>

    <h2>The seven virtues of Bushido</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gi (義) — righteousness:</strong> choosing what is right, even when it is difficult.</li>
      <li><strong>Yu (勇) — courage:</strong> acting despite fear, not the absence of fear.</li>
      <li><strong>Jin (仁) — benevolence:</strong> strength guided by compassion.</li>
      <li><strong>Rei (礼) — respect:</strong> conduct that reflects character.</li>
      <li><strong>Makoto (誠) — sincerity:</strong> alignment between words and actions.</li>
      <li><strong>Meiyo (名誉) — honor:</strong> responsibility for your name and your posture.</li>
      <li><strong>Chugi (忠義) — loyalty:</strong> fidelity to commitments and community.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to apply Bushido today</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>on the mat: discipline, respect for your partner, and ego control,</li>
      <li>at work: ownership of decisions and consequences,</li>
      <li>in life: act from values, not short-term convenience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Bushido reminds us that character is forged daily — through small choices, not big declarations.
