      Kaizen is the idea of daily improvement. It is not about revolution, but about upgrading the process step by step.
      In Aikido this is literally the practice of "one percent better" — better breathing today, better distance tomorrow,
      better entry the day after.

    <h2>How to apply Kaizen in training</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>pick one micro-element for each session (for example: hip work),</li>
      <li>measure progress weekly, not after a single class,</li>
      <li>prioritize consistency over intensity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Kaizen builds durability: fewer spectacular jumps, more stable long-term growth.
