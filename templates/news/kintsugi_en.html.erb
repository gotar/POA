    <p>
      Kintsugi is the art of repairing pottery with gold. Instead of masking damage, it highlights history.
      In personal development this means mistakes and crises do not have to be failure — they can become the source
      of a wiser and stronger form.
    </p>

    <h2>What does the Kintsugi perspective bring?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>greater resilience to setbacks,</li>
      <li>a realistic view of progress (without perfectionism),</li>
      <li>respect for your own path, including its cracks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Kintsugi teaches that maturity is not "being flawless" but integrating experience honestly.
