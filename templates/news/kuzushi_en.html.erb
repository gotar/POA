    <p>
      In Aikido, Kuzushi means taking a partner off balance in a controlled and safe way.
      It is the key to effective technique — without kuzushi, technique becomes a strength contest.

    <p>
      Off the mat, Kuzushi means the ability to change a system: sometimes you must disrupt an old habit
      to open the way for a better, more stable solution.
