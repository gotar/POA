    <p>
      Mushin is a state of clear action: the mind is calm and attentive.
      It does not overanalyze, it does not freeze reaction, and it does not waste energy on internal noise.
    </p>

    <h2>How to develop Mushin</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>return to your breath when tension rises,</li>
      <li>train fundamentals until they become natural,</li>
      <li>let go of the need to prove anything.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Mushin is not emptiness — it is access to full capability in the moment of action.
