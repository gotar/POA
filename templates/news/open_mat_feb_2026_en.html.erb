    <h1>POA Open Mat — February 2026</h1>
    <p class="news-meta">February 20, 2026</p>

    <p>
      On Friday we held an open mat for practitioners across different levels.
      The goal was a shared, cross-sectional training with high quality and no unnecessary pressure.
    </p>

    <h2>Training scope</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>ukemi progression (from basics to faster entries),</li>
      <li>distance work and stepping off the attack line,</li>
      <li>ikkyo and shiho nage variations with timing focus,</li>
      <li>short task-based randori in controlled tempo.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Thank you all for great energy and disciplined training.
      The next open mat will be announced in March.
