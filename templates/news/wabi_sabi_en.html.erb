    <p>
      Wabi-Sabi reminds us that everything is changing and imperfect — and that this is precisely where value lives.
      This perspective lowers the pressure of a perfect result and strengthens focus on process quality.
    </p>

    <h2>Wabi-Sabi on and off the mat</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>appreciating simple fundamentals done well,</li>
      <li>accepting natural stages of development,</li>
      <li>fewer comparisons, more conscious practice.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Wabi-Sabi brings calm and stability: instead of chasing perfection, you build real quality.
